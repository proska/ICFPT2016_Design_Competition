This repository contains the source code and tests related to hardware impelementation of MCTS based Trax game engine. 
The project includes a game simulator implemented in Scala to emulate and verify the algorithms and the HW implementation.

There are 4 differnet game agents implemented in simulator : Genetic algorithm agent, MCTS agent, Alpha-Beta Agent, Hueristic agent. There agents are implemented in both scala and java.
The HW design is also implemented in Scala using Chisel HDL language.
